"""
Splits a plain text file with newlines for paragraph endings
into a sequence of sentences, one sentence per line.
This is the first step in the alignement process.

Variant plain text files need to be placed in a folder.
This folder is referenced by the parameter "input_folder".

Resulting plain text files are written to an output folder.
This folder is referenced by the parameter "input_folder".
