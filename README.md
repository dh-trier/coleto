## What is coleto? Purpose and features 

Coleto is a text comparison, or collation, tool written in Python and using wdiff in the background. Its intended use is in the context of Computational Literary Studies, where texts may exist in more than one version and it is of interest to compare them. Coleto takes two similar but not identical versions of a text as input, identifies all passages with differences between the two versions, attempts to describe and classify each difference, and visualizes the results.

## Context 

Coleto has been developed by Christof Schöch (Trier University, Germany) for a joint project with Erik Ketzan (University of Cologne, Germany), in which we analyzed several versions of Andy Weirs _The Martian_. The corresponding article, which is also the reference publication for coleto, has recently been accepted for publication: 

* Erik Ketzan and Christof Schöch: “Detecting, Classifying and Contextualizing Edits in Textual Variants: Three Versions of Andy Weir’s The Martian“, _Digital Humanities Quarterly_. Accepted for publication, revisions requested.
