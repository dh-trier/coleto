"""
Uses subprocess to call wdiff from the command line.
You need to have wdiff installed.
Based on the input texts split into sentences,
wdiff first aligns the text, identifying insertions and deletions. 
It then identifies each location of difference between two aligned sentences.
A sanity check is included to make sure wdiff has run correctly.
